# Blog Website using React

This project is a responsive blogging website developed using React.js. It offers a user-friendly interface for adding and displaying blog posts, including a dynamic post submission form, and sections for the latest and trending posts.

## Features

- **Dynamic Post Submission**: Users can add new posts with a title, description, and an optional image link. 
- **Reverse Order Display**: Newly added posts appear at the top of the post list, thanks to reverse array mapping.
- **Image Handling**: In case an image link is not provided for a post, a default image is displayed.
- **Sections for Latest and Trending Posts**: Dedicated sections for showcasing the latest and trending blog topics.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
- **Interactive UI Elements**: Includes a header, navigation bar, and footer for easy navigation.
- **Conditional Form Display**: The post submission form is displayed only when the 'Add Post' button is clicked.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's `useState` hook for managing the state of posts and form inputs.
- **Timestamps**: Each post displays the time of its upload, providing a temporal context for readers.
